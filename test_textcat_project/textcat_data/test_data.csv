"Kingsgate Consolidated has completed a definitive feasibility study (DFS) at its Nueva Esperanza silver-gold heap leach project in Chile, which concluded that the development would require a capital cost of $140m.  The Nueva Esperanza project consists of three deposits, Arqueros, Teterita and Chimberos, located in northern Chile.  Kingsgate said that the DFS is based on a three million tonnes (Mt) a year heap leach operation with on-site power generation. The company intends to bring the project into production and create an operating base to identify additional areas of mineralisation within the current exploration license areas. The DFS found that the project is estimated to produce about 7.5 million ounces (Moz) a year of silver equivalent, based on the current reserves of 17.1Mt grading at 97g per tonne of silver and 0.27g per tonne of gold.  Based on the anticipated metallurgical recovery factors from test work to date, the projectâ€™s planned production is expected to be 40Moz of silver and 112,500oz of gold over an initial mine life of six years. Kingsgate Consolidated managing director and CEO Gavin Thomas said the company remains optimistic about the mineral endowment of the immediate vicinity, which has the potential to provide it with a long, sustainable operating presence in this region.  ""The decision to begin construction is anticipated in the second half of this year and will put Kingsgate back on a growth path and validate the underlying value of the project acquisition,"" Thomas said.  Site works are planned to start after this winter, while first production at Nueva Esperanza is anticipated for the first half of 2016.  Kingsgate said negotiations are underway with potential debt financers, with several options being considered to fund the project. ",8
"Mining and exploration firm Korab Resources has secured all permits required to develop a new phosphate mine in Australia.  Korab claims that the new phosphate mine at the Geolsec project has some of the best logistics and basic infrastructure of any rock phosphate project in Australia.  The mine is situated 2km from Batchelor town, about 70km south from the port of Darwin, which is the capital of the Northern Territory. Korab noted that it had started negotiations with users of rock phosphate, fertilisers and soil improvement products as well as with distributors and contractors providing aerial application services of fertilisers and soil improvement products in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Eastern States.  The start-up costs of the mine are low because of its geology and location and the company anticipates that it will cost less than $300,000 to begin production of the direct application phosphate fertiliser. Korab had previously announced high-grade assays from the phosphate deposit at about 39% phosphorous.  The company said the rock is highly reactive making it ideal for direct application to acidic soils, which are common along Australian coastline.  Korab expects that operating costs of the mine will be under $100 per tonne of rock, giving the company a high profit margin.  Korab operates various development projects in Ukraine, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, where it intends to produce gold, phosphate rock and magnesium.  The companyâ€™s developments include Bobrikovo gold and silver project in Ukraine, Winchester deposit and Geol Sec rock phosphate deposit. ",8
"Amara Mining has produced 42,348oz of gold at its Kalsaka/Sega mine in Burkina Faso, in 2013.  Gold production at the mine increased by 86% to 14,926oz in Q4 of 2013, when compared with 8,008oz produced in Q3.  The company said that the average headgrade of the Sega material stacked was 1.77g per tonne and it is anticipated to increase as it continues to access higher-grade areas. Amara anticipates to produce 60,000oz to 70,000oz at Kalsaka/Sega mine this year.  Amara Mining chief executive officer Peter Spivey said the company delivered all three of its key targets in 2013, which included the integration of Kalsaka and Sega, the completion of the Baomahun feasibility study and the delivery of a mineral resource update (six million ounces) for Yaoure. ""We are pleased to begin the new year by announcing that our revised FY2013 production guidance has been exceeded, despite the lower-grades we encountered as Kalsaka reached the end of its life and the delay in commencing production from Sega, and we look ahead to continued stronger production in 2014, as a result of the higher-grade Sega material,"" Spivey said.  West African-focused gold mining firm Amara has two growth projects, Baomahun and Yaoure, as well as three grassroots exploration licenses in Liberia.  Baomahun is a development stage project in Sierra Leone, which is anticipated to transform Amara into a more sustainable producer.  The feasibility study for the project was completed in Q2 of 2013, with an internal rate of return of 22% and a net present value of $127m.  Yaoure in CÃƒÂ´te dâ€™Ivoire is an advanced exploration project which is a large-scale, shallow-dipping sulphide deposit that underlies the earlier mined oxide resources. ",8

These include: Hodess has extensive experience in designing and constructing pharmaceutical and biotechnology cleanrooms. Many biotechnology and pharmaceutical cleanrooms are specified at Class 1000 to 100,000. Hodess has worked in many different areas, including pharmaceutical, medical device, medical packaging, tissue processing and bone harvesting. Particulate in these cleanrooms is the largest concern; contamination, the ability to keep the room clean typically using modular or stick built components with integral cove bases, cove corners, and coved ceilings to maintain a cleanable surface condition is crucial. Biotech and pharmaceutical cleanrooms tend to be sanitized in different ways and the different products are applicable depending on the sanitization methods employed. Concealed areas for bacterial growth are unacceptable. Hodess Construction specializes in these rooms. Typically they use technology that allows the seal of the cleanroom to not be broken if sanitation or filter changes must occur. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical cleanrooms typically focus heavily on pressurization control, elimination of cross contamination and filtration of outdoor air as well as indoor air. They also have specialty mechanical and electrical systems that Hodess has the expertise to design. Our experience has enabled us to perform numerous USP 797 c GMP compliant pharmaceutical retrofits. This new regulation affects pharmacies that prepare â€˜compound sterile preparations (CSPs)â€™. This has led many pharmacies and hospitals to create cleanroom environments. The goal is to reduce the potential for contamination, and although there are many factors, such as preparation and lack of quality assurance, an unclean environment is the first and easiest to get corrected. Hodess has completed several of these retrofits, by going into hospitals and pharmacies, without too much impact on surrounding operations, and completing the work in an efficient and timely manner.

"Follow the latest updates of the outbreak on our timeline.  Applied DNA Sciences and Takis Biotech have designed four Covid-19 vaccine candidates to help protect against the novel coronavirus.  The companies plan to manufacture the DNA vaccine candidates using PCR-based DNA (Linear DNA) manufacturing systems for preclinical testing in animals.  Last month, Applied DNA Sciences subsidiary Linea Rx expanded its collaboration with Takis Biotech for the preclinical development of a Linear DNA Covid-19 vaccine. The vaccine candidates were created using the structure of the Spike protein that allows the coronavirus to bind and infect the host cells.  One candidate comprises the complete spike gene. The remaining three preclinical vaccines are designed as variants that build on epitope mapping and assembling the related 'S' gene parts into a new synthetic Linear DNA gene, along with codon optimisation.  How long do you think it will take for a Covid-19 (coronavirus) vaccine to be made available globally? Also, Applied DNA Sciences has patent-pending approaches for genetic ensembles that boost the expression, folding efficiency and protein compartmentalisation. These could be made into the putative vaccine constructs based on the animal studies data.  Applied DNA Sciences and Linea Rx president and CEO Dr James Hayward said: ""We expect delivery of the 4 preclinical vaccine candidates from Takis in this month.  ""Within weeks of arrival, we expect to immediately scale up PCR-based production of each vaccine candidate and ship them back to Takis who will determine each vaccine's relative abilities to provoke an immune response in vaccinated mice.""  Under the agreement, Takis will vaccinate mice with the scaled-up Linear DNA synthetic genes for each of the four putative vaccines.  Sera from the mice will be tested for antibodies that attach to the purified Spike proteins. The potential positive candidates will be tested to determine their capacity to neutralise the coronavirus by blocking uptake of the virus in cells in culture and animal models.   j Query (document ).ready(function() { /* Companies carousel */ j Query('.carousel').slick({ dots: true, infinite: true, speed: 300, lazy Load:'ondemand', slides To Show: 1, slides To Scroll: 1, adaptive Height: true }); }); ",13
"The first GMP Academy Master Course took place from November 26 â€“ 28 at Particle Measuring Systems (PMS) in Italy. International experts met to share their knowledge and expertise on regulatory requirements and practical applications of contamination monitoring and control systems for aseptic processes and clean environments. The three-day course focused on designing an effective monitoring strategy for aseptic or sterile products and processes. PMS identified the need to facilitate the exchange of scientific information concerning good manufacturing practice (GMP) principles across generations, institutions, and colleagues. The etymology of ""academy"" underscores that this course focuses on the cultural accumulation of knowledge, and its development and transmission. Sharing of expertise through open and constructive dialogue is the main purpose of GMP Academy. How to Design a Sterile Contamination Control Strategy During the final discussion of pharmaceutical control strategies, presented by Anna Campanella, the following question was asked: It is possible for pharmaceutical quality to be the combination of Quality by Design (Qb D) and current Good Manufacturing Practices (c GMP)? The question simplifies a more complex argument. If the process is under control, all physical, chemical or biological risks to product contamination are under control. However, if we are strictly in compliance with c GMP guidelines, what kind of issues might occur? A very interesting discussion developed that centred on the steps for managing a contamination control strategy for an aseptic process and the tools used. All agreed that a process overview represents the first step, and then a causes and effects analysis should be performed. Fishbone diagrams can be a reliable tool for this analysis. A deeper and more detailed risk analysis of each event should then be assessed by FMECA. Based on the previous steps, effective CAPAs should be managed is this approach. Personnel training and qualification were evaluated with a specific focus on aseptic procedures. Interesting debates focused on the root cause analysis for contamination caused by personnel handling, with a clear distinction between incorrect handling of materials and incorrect interventions made inside the filling machine. These debates confirmed the importance of training and procedure understanding, which is also considered a hot topic of Pharma Sterility Assurance experts. Several publications about pharmaceutical quality were mentioned and discussed in consideration of auditor expectations. Proceeding of Sterility Assurance: Designing Pharmaceutical Processes with the Qb D Approach Limited information was provided by the University concerning basic pharmaceutical processes, highlighting the importance of direct professional experience and knowledge acquisition. Manufacturing design, quality management and process understanding are essential to the multi-factor approach for effectively analyzing pharmaceutical processes. Expertise was shared and discussed during the 3-days GMP Academy with a focus on improvement through continuous learning. Presentations by Gilberto Dalmaso described the primary phases and related criticalities of aseptic pharmaceutical processes and products. Marco Benvenuti, Andrea Castiglioni, and Anna Campanella emphasized the importance of a risk-based approach, both for qualification and validation of new areas and equipment, in addition to quality risk management of aseptic processes. Dr Ulrich Zuber shared an interesting case study concerning rapid on-line detection methods and an interesting idea about modern air and water monitoring strategies. A modern risk-based verification model was brought forward as the alternative to the traditional V-model, both referring to the ISPE Guide and ASTM E2500-13. The goal of ISPE is to make the implementation process for GMP systems cost-effective and effective for the lifecycle of the manufacturing system from concept to retirement. All the participants concluded the QRM approach combined with modern critical thinking principles and a science-based approach should be strongly recommended for optimal design and management of pharmaceutical processes. Food for thought was the discussion of vendor documentation and the advantages of early Subject Matter Expert (SME) involvement in project design. Scientific evidence supports total CFU counts representing a small portion of all microorganisms, and a pharmaceutical manufacturer evaluated the implementation of a modern alternative microbiological method to detect viable contaminants in water loops. Different on-line monitoring devices for Instantaneous Microbial Detection (IMD) were analyzed for both pure water (PW) and water for injection (WFI) loops. Experimental data obtained via IMD was consistent, but there were some difficulties in validation studies. In particular, there was a need to perform additional controlled experiments to establish a sound conversion rate between the standard method and the new technology. WFI loop sanitization and test condition reproducibility for traditional methods and new technologies were the main difficulties drastically lengthening implementation times. Education and Real Life Examples: A Gap or an Opportunity for Improvement? The opening presentation of GMP Academy concerned the analysis of the existing partnership between University and Industry. An interesting study was conducted with nearly 3,300 students from three different faculties to evaluate the main aspects of pharmaceutical processes studied at University. This study showed that of five post-degree courses activated in the last five years, few if any included the study of Qb D and ICH rules. Sterile process studies are not included in any course, including those within the umbrella of Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Technology. Professor Tuccinardi of Pisa University reported a general willingness among university students and researchers to attend presentations and training sessions provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers and suppliers. Also, he noted that some of the most important successful innovative drugs are the result of Industry and University collaboration and expertise. Several government bodies encourage and facilitate graduate and undergraduate participation in the pharmaceutical industry, providing the opportunity for the validation and implementation of new technologies. Past problems related to pharmaceutical products and processes were contrasted with a new and modern approach. Cleanroom and equipment validation, environmental monitoring data, trained and qualified operators have long been considered milestones of an effective contamination control strategy. Pharmaceutical process understanding shows us that achieving zero risk is not possible. Rather, it is risk management that should be used to achieve the most effective way to control contamination in pharmaceuticals. Our hope is for pharmaceutical experts to maintain their curiosity, enthusiasm, and quest for knowledge and understanding. We need them to be effective teachers with experience in the industry to teach the next generation to become the new experts for critical pharmaceutical processes.
