"Dargues Mine is a gold mining and milling operation located in the southern tablelands of New South Wales, approximately 60 km south-east of Canberra.    In December 2020 we completed the purchase of the Dargues Mine from Diversified Minerals Pty Ltd, for a purchase price of A $190 million (excluding a contingent payment of A $5 million).    The acquisition comprised the Dargues Mine, associated rural properties and regional exploration tenements.      The Dargues Mine produces a gold concentrate free of deleterious elements.      The first concentrate shipment from Dargues was exported in June 2020.    Mining Ore is mined at Dargues via conventional bottom-up longhole stoping and trucked from the underground mine to a surface stockpile adjacent to the process plant.      The process plant reached its nameplate capacity of 30kt per month in September 2020.      Underground ore production is expected to ramp-up to full capacity by mid-2021.      Exploration Aurelia has identified significant exploration upside potential at Dargues, with the existing mineral resource only constrained at depth by the location, quantity and density of drilling.    There is also clear potential for extensions to the Dargues deposit along strike.    Aurelia has prioritised an accelerated extensional and infill drilling program with completion of Phase 1 drilling targeted for mid-2021.",8

"Anglo Gold Ashanti reported on November 11 the Tropicana gold project in Western Australia has been approved by the boards of Anglo Gold Ashanti and Independence Group NL.    Anglo Gold Ashanti has a 70 % interest in the project, which is located 330 km east-northeast of Kalgoorlie in WA, and Independence Group has 30 %.    The approved project will produce 3.45 million oz of gold over a 10 year mine life at a cash cost of A $710$730/oz (US $696/oz $715/oz).    In the first three years of operation, gold production will be between 470,000490,000 oz/ y at a cash cost of A $580/oz $600/oz (US $568/oz $588/oz).    Capital expenditure, including pre-production operating costs, is estimated at A $725-$775 million including escalation (US $711$760 million.)    The JV partners said a higher production rate in the first three years will contribute to accelerated payback.    Discovered in a remote, barely explored area not previously thought prospective for gold, the project partners note Tropicana is the most significant gold discovery in Australia for more than a decadeand the joint ventures    first mover advantage has enabled it to stake the bulk of what is now recognized as a major new gold field.    Construction will begin in June 2011 and first gold is anticipated late in 2013.    Tropicana is the first of Anglo Gold Ashantis major gold discoveries to move into production, said CEO Mark Cutifani.    The decision to commit to development follows the successful outcome of a Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS) based on open-cut mining of the Tropicana and Havana deposits.    Anglo Gold Ashanti said the BFS does not take into account possible production from the Boston Shaker or Havana Deeps deposits.    The BFS was based on a Proved and Probable Reserve of 48 million mt grading 2.2 g / t for 3.4 million oz of gold.    The BFS mining inventory totaled 59 million mt grading 2 g / t for 3.8 million oz.    While the initial mine life is estimated at 10 years, the joint venture partners said they are confident it can be extended.    Step-out exploration drilling in late 2009 returned significant results from the Boston Shaker prospect, which lies approximately 360 m north of the Tropicana resource.    Drilling to date has identified the faulted offset of Tropicana mineralization over an 850 m strike length and the mineralization remains open at depth.    An open-pit scoping study based on data available to July 2010 has been completed on Boston Shaker and indicates an expansion to the current BFS open-pit resource is highly likely.    Boston Shaker progressed into full feasibility study in September 2010, with completion targeted for the first half of 2011.    Significant results were also received from the Havana Deeps prospect, which represents extensions of the Havana mineralized system external to the Havana open-pit.    The recently completed Havana Deeps scoping study, based on drilling data to the end of July 2010, indicates the potential viability of underground mining at Havana Deeps.    It is anticipated Havana Deeps will progress into a pre-feasibility study in early 2011.    The potential of Havana Deeps has been highlighted by a recent deep step-out exploration drill hole, which intersected the mineralized package at 1 km depth, in excess of 2.1 km down plunge of the Havana open-pit design.    Work was in progress to incorporate the results of the Boston Shaker and Havana Deeps scoping studies, along with subsequent drilling results, into a revised resource estimate by year-end.    In addition to the upside in the immediate mine area, the joint venture has more than 30 exploration targets within trucking distance of the mine, along with numerous anomalies on its 16,000-km2 tenement holding in the highly prospective Tropicana Belt.    Graham Ehm, executive vice president Australasia, said Tropicana would add to production from the 100 % owned Sunrise Dam mine to lift Anglo Gold Ashantis Australian gold output to 600,000 oz/ y by 2014.    Tropicana will rank as the fifth largest contributor to the companys global production in its first three years and will double the operating cash surplus generated by the Australian region, Ehm said.    He said the project would employ up to 550 people during construction, and up to 450 people during operations, as well as contributing an estimated A $836 million to the WA economy during construction and a further A $825 million during operations.    Infrastructure will include 220 km of new road from Pinjin to the site, a sealed all-weather airstrip and development of a borefield 50 km from the mine site for water supply.",8

"Australian innovator Altech Chemicals Ltd. announced last week that it has finalized an upgrade to the design for the planned high-purity alumina (HPA) plant in Malaysia, boosting the plant's capacity by 12.5 percent.   The capacity boost, which increases the plant's output from 4,000 metric tons per annum to 4,500 metric tons per annum, is part of an upgrade that included an overall optimization of the plant's flow sheet.   The modification will allow production of HPA for both synthetic sapphires (at a rate of up to 4,500 metric tons per annum) and for use in lithium-ion batteries (at a rate of up to 1,500 metric tons per annum of sub-micron particle powder).Altech says that its plant will produce HPA to an average particle size of under 1 micron initially by wet milling and will subsequently be dried in a conventional spray drier.   The powder will then be heat treated in a kiln tunnel, with the finished product a HPA bead of between 3 mm and 4 mm, making it suitable for use in synthetic sapphire production.   Altech Chemicals is based in Subiaco, Western Australia and is attempting to develop a marketable process for delivering 99.99 % (4N) HPA.   It plans to construct a 4,000 metric ton per annum HPA plant at Tanjung Langsat Industrial Complex, Johor, Malaysia.   The firm is fast-tracking HPA production due to an agreement with Mitsubishi for 100 % of its proposed HPA production for ten years.   At present, Altech intends to commence project development in 2018.",8
"Credit: Rio Tinto Rio Tinto has announced that the first production from its new lithium mine in the Jadar Valley, Serbia, has been pushed back by at least a year due to slow progress in obtaining the necessary licenses for an environmental assessment.    The delay means that the first saleable production from the project will be available by 2027, rather than 2026 as first projected.    Progress on the mine had also been curtailed by a sustained protest movementobjectingto Rio Tintos Jadar lithium project, and Zijin Minings recently openedukaru Peki copper and gold mine, which they claim will pollute land and water in the Balkan nation.    The prime minister of Serbia, Ana Brnabi, has said that this Aprils general election will decide whether Rio can develop the mine.    I think it is a decision for the future, and I believe it would be smarter, better, and fairer if it is brought by the political elites that will lead the country in the next four years, she told Reuterslast week.    In response to these concerns, Rio Tinto released a statement: We fully understand the concerns amongst some Serbian stakeholders about environmental impacts, and we will continue to engage in demonstrating the project has developed mitigation solutions in the project plan.    Rios lithium push    If the project goes ahead, Jadar will become one of thebiggestlithium mines in the world, with a construction cost estimated at $2.4bn.    Rio Tinto has estimated that over its 40-year life, the mine will produce 2.3 million tonnes of battery-grade lithium carbonate and 160,000 tonnes of boric acid annually.    While most other diversified miners have not invested heavily in the commodity, Rio Tintos chief executive Jakob Stausholm believes that the company can exploit a looming supply gap by moving quickly.    As a result, Rio has invested heavily in the sector.    Last month they agreed an $825 m purchase of the Salar del Rincnlithium project in the Salta province of Argentina.

"By Greg Johnson, Gillette News Record Via-  Wyoming News Exchange GILLETTE     Nearly 600 Blackjewel LLC coal workers in Wyoming and West Virginia may see a monthlong forced layoff end soon after the company has agreed to sell a trio of mines to   Contura Energy Inc. An agreement to sell the company's flagship Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines in Campbell County, along with the Pax Surface Mine in West Virginia, was one of the notable outcomes of a marathon three-day Chapter 11 bankruptcy auction that began Thursday morning and concluded about 8:45 p.m. Saturday.   After a competitive bidding process, Contura will buy the three mines for $33.75 million cash and assume $251 million in reclamation obligations.   The winning bid reflects an increase of $13.25 million from Contura's initial stalking horse bid.   The sale of Blackjewel's Western assets was relatively straightforward and Contura has already said it plans to reopen the mines and begin producing coal again.   For the company's dozens of Eastern operations and its 1,100 locked out employees, it's not immediately clear which mines, if any, may or may not reopen.   According to an auction update filed Sunday morning with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, some Eastern assets were sold to a handful of combined bidders.   Overall, the Eastern assets were sold for about $9 million in cash and another $50.4 million in credit bids from Blackjewel debt holders and royalty agreements.   The successful bids also assume $357.3 million in liabilities associated with the properties.   A sale hearing was scheduled for Monday morning.   Here's a breakdown of Blackjewel's winning auction results for Eastern assets: Kopper Glo Mining LLC: Will buy Black Mountain and Lone Mountain; agreed to pay $7.55 million in cash and royalties with a net present value of $9.1 million as a credit bid; assume $38.4 million in asset retirement obligations (ARO); Rhino Energy LLC: Will buy Virginia Subdivision Assets; agreed to pay $850,000 and $208,000 in royalties; assume $6.07 million in ARO; Coking Coal LLC: Will buy the Pardee mine; agreed to pay $50,000 and royalties with a net present value of $2.419 million; assume $1.2 million in ARO;   Tye Fork Coal Co. Inc.:Will buy the mine designated LM6; agreed to pay $400,000; assume $75,000 in ARO, and Javelin Global Commodities:   This company owns 30 % interest in Blackjewel Marketing and Sales; will pay $125,000; another $1.4 million in cash will be paid by Blackjewel Marketing and Sales as a settlement to resolve various disputes between BJMS and the company.   Mark Energy LLC bid $2,000 cash for the mine designated LM8; Dean-Mc Afee Lenders proffered a credit bid for Harlan County, Kentucky, assets.   There were no other details about this bid in Sunday's filing, and John Deere Construction and Forestry Co. made a credit bid on equipment it claims is subject to a valid lien.",8

"Newlox Gold Ventures Corp (CSE: LUX) this morning announced the advancement of the firms second processing plant, referred to as the Boston Project.    The plant, at full scale, is anticipated to see 150 tonnes of throughput per day, with material grading 15 grams per tonne gold or higher.    The Boston Project is currently anticipated to enter production early in the second quarter, with the facility to be operated in conjunction with local mining groups.    Located in the historic Juntas Gold Camp of Costa Rica, the plant will see local partners supply freshly mined feedstock to the plant, which will then be processed by Newlox.      The operation is working under a model whereby net revenues after all production costs will be split 50/50 between the miners and Newlox.    The Boston area, which is where the mine is located, currently hosts three historical mines that were focused on veins up to 5 metres thick, with average grades of 7.41 g / t to 12.6 g / t gold.    The historical mines have been worked for the past three decades by the firms artisanal mining partners, with current grades said to be exceeding historical average grades.    Grades within the large Juntas camp as a whole are said to average a higher historical production figure, with the partners currently mining a region, the Tres Hermanos, that averages 16 g / t gold.    Newlox Gold expects to have a transformational year in 2021; the Companys first processing plant is expected to achieve full-scale production, and the Boston Project is slated to enter production early in the second quarter.    Additionally, Newlox is actively evaluating projects in neighbouring jurisdictions and plans to select and announce its third project in the spring with the intention of starting construction at Project 3 in the second half of 2021.Ryan Jackson, CEO of Newlox Gold    The announcement of the advancement of the Boston Project follows the firms Friday evening announcement that it has closed a financing for gross proceeds of $2.8 million, which was raised via a convertible debenture financing.

"The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center is planning a $15 million expansion of its greenhouses with the help of Missouri tax credits.    The nonprofit plant science research institute based in Creve Coeur says its greenhouses are operating at 90 percent capacity, with demand for lab equipment and greenhouse space beginning to lead to overcrowding.    The St. Louis Economic Development Partnership board voted Wednesday to endorse the proposal and apply to the Missouri Development Finance Board for $5 million in tax credits to support the expansion.    The tax credits, which reimburse 50 percent of a private donors contribution, are intended to leverage $10 million in private donations for the project.    The new wing will house 100 scientists and be named in honor of former WU Chancellor Dr. William H. Danforth    There is current demand for additional greenhouses, as current as today, said Janet Wilding, who handles major projects for the partnership, particularly in the agricultural technology district 39 North where the Danforth Center is located.    The Danforth Center project would include a 19,000-square-foot expansion with 11 new greenhouses and specialty equipment.

Many agricultural tech companies in the 39 North plant science cluster near the former Monsanto (now Bayers plant science division) headquarters use the Danforth Center for research and greenhouse space.    Often, those companies are located nearby in the Helix Center plant science incubator, owned by the partnership.    Benson Hill Biosystems is looking to expand and interested in occupying a 40,000 square-foot expansion of the Creve Coeur plant science incubator.    The partnership is in the midst of finalizing a deal to expand the Helix Center for one of the most promising companies there: Benson Hill Biosystems, which in September announced a $60 million investment from GV, formerly known as Google Ventures.    Benson Hill uses big data techniques to help analyze and sequence genes and has a system that makes the technology more accessible to smaller seed companies.    The partnership approved a new deadline Wednesday to finalize a 40,000-square-foot office and lab space lease with Benson Hill in an expanded Helix Center.    The partnership is still finalizing details on a roughly $13.5 million financing package for the expansion.    Board member Mary Campbell, who heads real estate at Washington University, said the short deadline extension to Jan. 15 was to keep everybodys feet to the fire.    Also planned for the Helix Center is an outpost of lab space operator Bio Generator, which caters to entrepreneurs.    It operates lab space in the Cortex district, where users tend to be biotech-and pharmaceutical-heavy.    The new outpost would cater to the agriculture tech firms that are concentrated in Creve Coeur.    The county-owned incubator there, the Helix Center, is also eligible for a state grant if the Partnership can match it.    Bio Generator, operated by local biotech group Bio STL, entered into a lease at the Helix Center last month, according to the partnership.    A $300,000 Missouri Technology Corporation grant awarded to the partnership in February to pay for improvements to the Helix Center will be used to assist with the project.    Bio Generators lease payments will provide the local match to access the grant.    The business news you need Get the latest local business news delivered FREE to your inbox weekly.",12

"The union contract between General Motors Co. and the United Auto Workers expired Saturday night without any agreement or extension, sparking thefirst major labor strike in the United States in 12 years.    Talks to avert a strike were unsuccessful Sunday.    The UAW represents46,000 members at 31 GM factories and 21 other facilities nationwide   including 3,000 at two Buffalo-area plants.    The UAW has insisted that the automaker needs to come closer in meeting its demands for higher wages, affordable health care, job security, profit-sharing and a path to' permanent seniority' for temporary workers.    The union says it stepped up to help the company when GM was in trouble, and now that the company is earning tens of billions of dollars a year, it needs to give back to its workforce.    We stood up for General Motors when they needed us most,' said UAW Vice President Terry Dittes in a written statement.    The Detroit-based company, for its part, says it hasalready made a generous offer, citing more than $7 billion in U.S. investments in eight facilities in four states, higher wages and profit-sharing, improved benefits and more than 5,400 jobs during the term of the contract.    We presented a strong offer that improves wages, benefits and grows U.S. jobs in substantive ways and it is disappointing that the UAW leadership has chosen to strike at midnight tonight,' the company said in a statement.    The company also said it offered' solutions' for plants in Michigan and Ohio that have been targeted for closure, reportedly including the introduction of new electric trucks, additional new vehicle and propulsion programs, and the opportunity for the first union-represented battery-cell manufacturing site in the country.    We think the offer that s on the table is very fair, said GM spokesman Dan Flores in a phone interview Sunday.    We do nt want a strike, but the UAW obviously has chosen to pursue this, and we hope if they do walk out, it ll be short.    The two sides remained far apart on several key issues Sunday.    But as the day wore on, the two sides continued to talk.    The UAW already extended its contracts with Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler   both of which also faced expiration at the same time   as the union made GM the focus of its bargaining efforts.    GM maintains two key manufacturing plants with more than 3,000 workers in the Buffalo Niagara region, with its engine complex in the Town of Tonawanda and a components plant in Lockport.

"The Australian Industry Energy Transition Initiative is now worth a quarter of the ASX100, as Rio Tinto joins the ranks.      Rio Tinto and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) have partnered to investigate processing with hydrogen instead of natural gas at the Yarwun alumina refinery in Gladstone, Queensland.    Using a $579,786 grant from the federal government   which runs ARENA   the project will initiate a trial phase with an aim to reduce emissions across the aluminium supply chain.    ARENA chief executive officer Darren Miller said this presented a step-change opportunity in aluminium processing.    If we can replace fossil fuels with clean hydrogen in the refining process for alumina, this will reduce emissions in the energy and emissions intensive refining stage of the aluminium supply chain, Miller said.    With five bauxite mines, four alumina refineries and 14 aluminium refineries around the world, Rio Tinto plays a large role in the global aluminium industry.    Rio Tinto acting managing director for Pacific operations aluminium, Daniel van der Westhuizen, recognised the global impact projects like this could have on aluminiums carbon emissions.    We see the ARENA and Rio Tinto-funded study as a step towards reducing refinery emissions and one that has the potential to play an important part in Rio Tintos commitment to decarbonisation, van der Westhuizen said.    Were investing in work that needs to be done, not only to decarbonise one of our sites, but also to help provide a lower-emissions pathway for Rio Tinto and the global aluminium industry.    The project will involve an initial engineering and design study to define the construction and operational requirements at Yarwun.    The second stage will see a lab-scale reactor simulate the calcination process at the Bundoora Technical Development Centre, in Victoria.    Federal Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor underlined the importance of the aluminium industry.    The aluminium industry is a valuable sector of our economy, both in terms of export earnings and as an employer of more than 22,000 Australians, Taylor said.    It is our sixth largest export by value, earning $12.7 billion in 2019-20.    Australia is also the worlds largest exporter of alumina and accounts for around 15 per cent of global refining capacity.",8

"By the BF Editorial Staff From the January/February 2020 Issue What do the award winners for the top three prizes in BF's 2019 Deal of the Year competition have in common? Here's a hint: the projects (and the organizations behind them) that snared our Gold, Silver and Bronze trophies each revolve around automobiles. The Gold Award (see below) in our hotly contested 2019 DOTY contest went to Michigan Economic Development Corp. for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' (FCA) $4.5-billion expansion in Michigan, which includes a new Jeep assembly plant in Detroit  - the first new OEM assembly plant to rise in Motown in nearly three decades. [The revival in Motown accelerated with GM's announcement at press time that it will invest $2.2-billion to convert its aging Detroit-Hamtramck plant into an assembly line for a new electric Hummer pickup truck]. Our Silver Award was captured by Jackson County (GA) Area Chamber of Commerce for a critical component that no doubt will power most of the vehicles built in the remainder of the 21st century: lithium-ion batteries. South Korea-based SK Group is aiming to be the major battery supplier to automotive OEMs in the Southeast, including nearby KIA, with its $1.67-billion plant in Commerce, GA. The project that earned the City of Dallas, TX our Bronze Award doesn't involve an automaker (or an automotive parts supplier), but Uber's new administrative hub will touch millions of people who ride in motor vehicles driven by its drivers. The ride-sharing giant was looking for an ultra-cool, 24/7 neighborhood in a U.S. city and Big D's historic Deep Ellum district fit the bill to a T. Howdy, hipsters.

"LOWER SALFORD      New jobs are one of the focuses of business development efforts, but the number of jobs that are maintained is also important, Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development Acting Secretary Neil Weaver said while making an Aug. 11 stop at Almac Groups North American headquarters in Lower Salford.    The company announced in July that it will invest about $93.5 million in the next three years for Pennsylvania operations and facilities, including an expansion that will create at least 355 new Montgomery County jobs and retain 1,434 existing jobs.    Along with its Lower Salford facilities, known as the Souderton location, the companys Montgomery County sites include ones in Audubon and Lansdale.    The pharmaceutical development and manufacturing company, which has locations worldwide, is based in Northern Ireland.    Along with creating new jobs, retaining jobs is crucial, Weaver said.    Pennsylvania Department of Community & Economic Development Acting Secretary Neil Weaver tours the Almac production facilities in Lower Salford Township Thursday, Aug. 11, 2022.    (Bob Keeler-Media News Group)The downstream effect of keeping those people here is just another added economic benefit.    Those employees who live here are shopping at local stores, are eating at local restaurants, filling up at local gas stations and injecting funding and money into the local economy, Weaver said.    The plans include a $65 million, 100,000 square-foot addition to the existing Lower Salford facilities.    Almac is a partner of choice of hundreds of pharmaceutical and biotech companies worldwide, said Robert Dunlop, president and managing director, Almac Clinical Services.    Robert Dunlop, president and managing director, Almac Clinical Services, speaks Aug. 11 at Almac Groups North American headquarters in Lower Salford where a 100,000 square-foot expansion is planned.    (Bob Keeler-Media News Group)Our position in the market gives us a front row vantage point on how drug development and clinical trials are continuing to evolve across the world, Dunlop said.    Almac is at the forefront of building supply chain expertise and capacity for this evolution.    Groundbreaking for the Lower Salford expansion is planned for early 2023, he said.    This is the second Almac expansion in recent years, both of which were coordinated by the Governors Action Team, Weaver said.    The company is getting state grants of $1.775 million from DCEDs Pennsylvania First grants and $250,000 in workforce development grants.    Pennsylvania Department of Community & Economic Development Acting Secretary Neil Weaver speaks at Almac in Lower Salford on Aug. 11, 2022.

"Days after closing the acquisition of the Blackwater gold project in central British Columbia from producer New Gold (TSX: NGD;    NYSE-AM: NGD), Artemis Gold (TSXV: ARTG) has released the results of a revised prefeasibility study on the asset.    The first, five-year phase would be at a throughput of 5 million tonnes per year, increasing to 12 million tonnes per year for the next five years, before ramping up to 20 million tonnes annually for the remainder of the life of mine.    As a result, in the first stage, Blackwater would generate an average of 248,000 oz.    gold per year, at all-in sustaining costs (AISCs) of $668 per oz., increasing to 420,000 oz.    annually at AISCs of $696 per oz.    for the following five years, and then generate 316,000 oz.    annually at AISCs of $911 per oz.    The initial capital cost estimate stands at $592 million, with expansion capital outlays estimated at $426 million and $398 million for the second and third phases, respectively.    With total life-of-mine gold production of 7.5 million oz.    at AISCs of US $616 per oz.  , the after-tax net present value estimate for the project would be $2.25 billion, at a 5 % discount rate, based on US $1,541 per oz.    gold and US $19.60 per oz.    The strategy of staging the ultimate development of the mine, among other de-risking initiatives, allows for much improved economics, while allowing the company to phase the development before ramping up to full throughput of 20 million tonnes per annum, Steven Dean, the companys chairman and CEO, said in a press release.    The phased approach provides the opportunity to build the Blackwater project into a new 250,000 oz. per year gold operation, growing to more than 400,000 oz. of gold per year with growth financed from free cash flow.    We believe that this disciplined approach is the most prudent way to advance one of the largest undeveloped gold projects in Canada.    When compared with New Golds 2014 feasibility study for Blackwater, the updated development scenario features a lower-throughput operation with lower upfront capital costs and a more moderate production profile.    The feasibility estimated US $1.9 million in initial capital, for a 22-million-tonne-per-year throughput mine, which would generate 485,000 oz.    gold per year over the first nine years at AISCs of US $685 per ounce.    The scenario presented by Artemis assumes mining of higher-grade, near-surface material in the southern half of the Blackwater deposit in the first phase of operations to improve economics, with the staged expansions funded out of operating cash flows.    Blackwater reserves total 334 million tonnes, grading 0.75 gram gold per tonne and 5.8 grams silver per tonne   or 0.78 gram per tonne gold-equivalent   and contain 8 million oz.    gold and 62.1 million oz.    Artemis announced the Blackwater purchase in June.    The company paid New Gold $140 million and issued approximately $20 million in its shares on closing of the deal, with an additional, $50-million payment due in 12 months.    New Gold will also receive a gold stream of 8 % of the refined gold, at 35 % of the U.S. dollar gold price estimated two days prior to delivery.    Once 279,908 oz.    Over the next year and a half, Artemis plans to start a feasibility study on the project, based on this most recent development approach.    Additional permitting work is also planned, to achieve the permits required to start construction (the project received a provincial Environmental Assessment certificate last year), in addition to financing arrangements to support the development plan.    Artemis is a gold developer, spun out of Atlantic Gold, prior to the companys acquisition by Australias St. Barbara last year.      This article first appeared in the Canadian Mining Journal.",8
"Alkane Resources   Alkane Resources plans to fund future exploration at its highly prospective East Lachlan gold assets in New South Wales with a $54.8 million capital raising.    The funds will be used to accelerate resource drilling across the Tomingley corridor, including step-out drilling at the Boda prospect and exploring other porphyry targets across the North Molong porphyry project.    Alkane is expecting approvals no later than January 2020 to develop an underground exploration decline that would drive underground from the Wyoming One mine to its Roswell and San Antonio prospects.    The company is also looking to purchase another section of land within the Tomingley corridor to support the underground decline.    The continued exploration at Boda, where step-out drilling is underway, has considerable potential to create value for Alkane shareholders, Alkane managing director Nic Earner said.    Alkanes 2020 program aims not only to assess Boda and surrounding mineralisation, but also to test other Boda-style targets across our licences.    A promising discovery, the Boda prospect has been compared with Newcrest Minings Cadia Valley mine, with drilling in September returning high-grade results.    Alkanes raising, at 55 cents / share, includes an institutional placement of new ordinary shares to raise $20 million and a one-for-eight non-renounceable rights issue to raise up to a further $34.8 million.    The majority of new shares to be issued are scheduled to settle on December 4, with substantial holder Abbotsleigh agreeing to subscribe for approximately $4.73 million.",8
